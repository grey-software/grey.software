### Here's what Osama had to say about his experience!

_"Last May, I started working with Arsala as an Explorer in Grey Software where we got to co-develop [SLAV: an algorithm visualizer](https://slav.grey.software) hosted on the web. After we got the project to a decent working stage at which point I joined the organization as a part-time core software engineer helping with both front-end and back-end development._

_Within these 4 months, I received valuable mentorship from Arsala from a technical POV and on a personal level. We had many enriching technical discussions where I developed my maturity in SWE and became more independent._ 

_When my interview project required me to develop an angular web application with a front end UI and C# back-end, I was able to tackle the task because of the full-stack experience I got as an engineer at Grey Software."_
