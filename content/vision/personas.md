## Shawn the Apprentice

Shawn is a computer science student who is passionate about software engineering. He wants to become a better software engineer by building applications that users can interact with. 

Shawn has worked on side projects and has contributed successfully to team projects in school. Heâ€™s a capable budding engineer with enough technical context to learn how to build a non-trivial piece of software if given the time and incentive.

Shawn wants to take his software engineering skills to the next level by working on larger, real-world software projects.

## Nina the Explorer

Nina is a computer science student who has creative vision, and she wants to learn software engineering by building apps that bring her creative vision to life. 

Nina has contributed successfully to team projects in school, but she lacks the depth of technical understanding that can allow her to learn how to build a large application on her own. 

Nina wonders if there is a way for her to learn how to build apps that:
Offers a structured roadmap to implementation 
Eases the learning curve of picking up new technologies. 

Nina wants to learn software engineering to see if app development is a suitable career move for her.
